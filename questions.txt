- Why apollo doesnt store data in cache as titi project?


What does these plugins? and why doesnt have titi project these plugins?
devDependencies:
    - "@vue/cli-plugin-router": "~4.5.0",
    - "@vue/cli-plugin-vuex": "~4.5.0",

Why titi project has these dependencies and never use them?
or is this used in other side?
dependencies:
    "apollo-boost": "^0.4.7",
    "apollo-cache-inmemory": "^1.6.5",
    "apollo-client": "^2.6.8",
-> Do I have to install them in custom plush project?
Uhmmmmmmm. Without them, graphql is working so well
